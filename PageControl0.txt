@property(nonatomic) NSInteger currentPage
Discussion
The property value is an integer specifying the current page shown minus one; thus a value of zero (the default) indicates the first page. A page control shows the current page as a white dot. Values outside the possible range are pinned to either 0 or numberOfPages minus 1.
